## Authors

A successful open-source project relies upon the community to:

* discuss requirements and possible designs
* submit code and tests
* identify and fix bugs
* create documentation and examples
* provide feedback
* support each other

The project has been extracted from the [Spire](https://github.com/non/spire) project;
the initial implementation was based on various proposals circulating in 2014-2015
for a non-boxing Option; see, for example [valueclassoption](https://github.com/rklaehn/valueclassoption).
