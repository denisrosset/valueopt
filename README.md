## Opt - AnyVal Option-like type

Opt is a utility library that provides a fast Option-like type.

The differences of `Opt` with the standard library `Option` are:

- `Opt` is designed to replace `Option` in hot code paths, or for library methods designed to be used in hot code paths.

- `Opt` is not fully referentially transparent: the `get` method throws a `NullPointerException` 

- After the project leaves beta status, the core module, including the structure of the `Opt` value class itself will not change, guaranteeing binary compatibility. 

- Methods such as `getOrElse`, `fold`, ... are implemented using macros, and thus produce efficient code that avoids passing closures.

- `Opt` cannot store `null` by design; `null` is conflated with the `Opt.empty` case.

- `Opt` is not designed to be abstracted over (i.e. `type F[A] = Opt[A]`), doing so removes all benefits of the value class. For this purpose, use `Option` instead.

- `Opt` always allocates less memory than `Option`. It is a value class that erases to a reference type when storing reference types; for primitive types, it stores their boxed versions and erases to a reference type as well. In constrast, `Some[Int]` allocates an `Some` instance containing a boxed `Int` (which could lead or not to an additional allocation).

- Pattern matching on `Opt` is provided using name-based extractors, to avoid boxing during pattern match (while `Option` is an algebraic datatype represented by `sealed Option` and the final `Some` and `None` types). Code example:

```scala

def testPatternMatch: Unit = {

	val nonEmptyOpt: Opt[Int] = Opt(2)
	val emptyOpt: Opt[Int] = Opt.empty[Int]
	
    nonEmptyOpt match {
      case Opt(x) => println("Success!")
      case _ => ??? // is not taken
    }
	
    emptyOpt match {
      case Opt(x) => ??? // is not taken
      case _ => println("Success!")
    }
	
}
```

- A fully compatible but boxing version of `Opt` is provided for Scala 2.10 due to a compiler bug.
